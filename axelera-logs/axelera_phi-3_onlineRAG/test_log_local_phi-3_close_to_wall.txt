Sample Index: 6
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Don't move 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 9 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [-0.35, -0.35, -0.35, -0.35, -0.35, -0.35, -0.35, -0.35, -0.35]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [3.8, 3.8, 3.8, 3.8, 3.8, 3.8, 3.8, 3.8, 3.8]

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

- The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
- The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.35, 0.3, 0.32, 0.33, 0.34]
The oscillation can be observed between the left and right distances to the walls (0.35, 0.3, 0.32, 0.33, 0.34). The car's deviation is oscillating and changing signs, which is consistent with the car oscillating around the racing line.

Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 10:

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Adhering to the given instructions, the car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) oscillates between 0.2 and 0.4 meters, which is within the negligible range of 0.3 meters. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is between 5 and 6.2 meters per second, which is also within the specified range. However, the car is oscillating between the left and right distances to the walls, which are about equal, indicating that the car is not facing the wall.
Explanation: The car's behavior is oscillating in the lateral direction with a small enough magnitude (0.2 to 0.4 meters) that it can be considered as adhering to the racing line. The car's forward speed (5 to 6.2 meters per second) is within the range that the human has set for optimal racing line adherence.

Sample Index: 14
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 11 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [-0.35, -0.35, -0.35, -0.35, -0.35, -0.35, -0.35, -0.35, -0.35, -0.35, -0.35]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7, 4.7]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
