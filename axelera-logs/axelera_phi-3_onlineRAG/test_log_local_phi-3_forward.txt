        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation:
To determine if the car is driving forward, we need to analyze the given data. The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate, and the car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed.
Adheringing to Human:
1. The car's position along the racing line is [0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0], and the car's speed along the racing line is [6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5].
2. The car's current average speed is (6.5 + 6.5 + 6.5 + 6.5 + 6.5 + 6.5 + 6.5 + 6.5 + 6.5 + 6.5 + 6.5 + 6.5 + 6.5 + 6.5 + 6.5) / 15 = 6.5 m/s.
3. The car is close to the wall when the distance to the wall is smaller than 0.4m. In this case, the car's distance to the wall is oscillating between 0.1m and 0.3m, which means the car is oscillating around the racing line.
4. The car is oscillating around the racing line when the difference between the s-coordinate and the d-coordinate is larger than 0.3m. In this case, the car's d-coordinate is oscillating between -0.1m and 0.1m, which means the car is oscillating around the racing line.
5. The car is not adhering to the human's desired speed and position on the racing line.
6. The car is oscillating around the racing line, which is not the same as the car's current average speed and position on the racing line.
7. The car is oscillating around the racing line when the difference between the s-coordinate and the d-coordinate is larger than 0.3m. In this case, the car's d-coordinate is oscillating between -0.1m and 0.1m, which means the car is oscillating around the racing line.
8. The car is oscillating around the racing line when the difference between the s-coordinate and the d-coordinate is larger than 0.3m. In this case, the car's d-coordinate is oscillating between -0.1m and 0.1m, which means the car is oscillating around the racing line.
9. The car is oscillating around the racing line when the difference between the s-coordinate and the d-coordinate is larger than 0.3m. In this case, the car's d-coordinate is oscillating between -0.1m and 0.1m, which means the car is oscillating around the racing line.
10. The car is oscillating around the racing line when the difference between the s-coordinate and the d-coordinate is larger than 0.3m. In this case, the car's d-coordinate is oscillating between -0.1m and 0.1m, which means the car is oscillating around the racing line.
11. The car is oscillating around the racing line when the difference between the s-coordinate and the d-coordinate is larger than 0.3m. In this case, the car's d-coordinate is oscillating between -0.1m and 0.1m, which means the car is oscillating around the racing line.
12. The car is oscillating around the racing line when the difference between the s-coordinate and the d-coordinate is larger than 0.3m. In this case, the car's d-coordinate is oscillating between -0.1m and 0.1m, which means the car is oscillating around the racing line.
13. The car is oscillating around the racing line when the difference between the s-coordinate and the d-coordinate is larger than 0.3m. In this case, the car's d-coordinate is oscillating between -0.1m and 0.1m, which means the car is oscillating around the racing line.

        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
