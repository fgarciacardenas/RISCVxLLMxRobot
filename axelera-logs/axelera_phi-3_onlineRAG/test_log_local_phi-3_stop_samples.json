The car's position along the racing line (s-coordinate) is given by the s-values [10, 10, 10, 10, 10], which indicates that the car is consistently 10m from the start of the track. The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is given by the d-values [0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5], which is within the acceptable range of 0.3m. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is given by the s-values [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which means the car is not moving along the s-coordinate. The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is given by the d-values [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which is also within the acceptable range of 0.5m/s. The distance to the left wall (l-coordinate) and the distance to the right wall (r-coordinate) are both given by the same values [0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3], which indicates that the car is equidistant from both walls. The Bool if the car is reversing is False, and the Bool if the car is facing the wall is False, which means the car is not reversing or facing the wall. The Bool if the car is crashed is False, which means the car is not in a crashed state.\nConsidering the given data and the human's instructions, the car is adhering to the racing line and is not in a crashed state.", "sanitized_output": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 632, "rag_tokens": 158, "output_tokens": 446}
