Test Case: Drive on the centerline
Sample Index: 7
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 6 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1.2, 2.5, 4.0, 5.5, 7.1]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.8, 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, 1.0, 1.05]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.2, 1.15, 1.1, 1.05, 1.0, 0.95]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Adhering to Human: False
The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) oscillates between 0.1m and 0.2m, which is within the acceptable range. However, the oscillation of the d-coordinate from positive to negative values with a magnitude of 0.3m or more indicates that the car is not maintaining a consistent position on the racing line.
To improve the situation, the car should focus on the following:
1. The car is oscillating around the racing line, which is not ideal for optimizing the lap time.
2. The car should aim to reduce the oscillation and maintain a lateral deviation (d-coordinate) of less than 0.3m from the racing line.
3. The car should also ensure that it stays on the racing line by avoiding crossing the d-coordinate with a magnitude of 0.3m or more.

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 12 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, -0.1, 0.2, -0.2, 0.1, -0.1, 0.2, -0.2, 0.1, -0.1, 0.2, -0.2]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [4, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 5]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.3]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.2, 1.1, 1.3, 1.0, 1.2, 1.1, 1.3, 1.0, 1.2, 1.1, 1.3, 1.0]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.0, 1.2, 1.0, 1.3, 1.0, 1.2, 1.0, 1.3, 1.0, 1.2, 1.0, 1.3]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
