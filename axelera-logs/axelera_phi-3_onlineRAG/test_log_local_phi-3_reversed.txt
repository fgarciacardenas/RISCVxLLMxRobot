        The data has been sampled for 0 seconds in 11 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [100.5, 100.3, 100.1, 99.9, 99.7, 99.5, 99.3, 99.1, 98.9, 98.7, 98.5]

If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:

Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.

        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive close to the left wall 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 4 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 9, 8, 7]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.2, 0.1, 0.0, -0.1]

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Test Case: Drive on the racing line
Sample Index: 16
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 0 seconds in 10 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [50, 48, 46, 44, 42, 40, 38, 36, 34, 32]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0, -0.1, -0.2, -0.3, -0.4]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [-2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6, 0.6]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: True

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the racing line. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car is currently 0.5m from the left wall and 0.4m from the right wall, with a s-coordinate of 32m on the racing line, and the s-speed of -2m/s. The car's lateral deviation from the racing line (d-coordinate) is oscillating between -0.3m and -0.1m, which indicates the car is oscillating around the racing line. The Bool values for the car's direction and crash status are True and False, respectively.
Adhering to Human: True
The Bool values for the car's status are True and False, which indicates the car is not close to the wall (False for the distance to the wall Bool).
Adhering to Human: False
The Bool values for the car's status are True and False, which indicates the car is facing the wall (True for the car Bool).

The car's speed along the racing line is not oscillating, which is desirable for maintaining a straight line on the track.
The distance to the left wall is within the acceptable range, indicating the car is close to the wall and thus on the racing line.
The distance to the right wall is the same as the distance to the left wall, which is consistent with the car being on the racing line.
The car is not reversing, as the Bool if the car is reversing is True.
The Bool if the car has crashed is False, which is not relevant to the car being on the racing line.
The Bool if the car is facing the wall is True, which is consistent with the car being on the racing line.
The car is not shown to be oscillating around the racing line since the Bool if the car is oscillating from the racing line is True.
The car is not shown to be oscillating around the centerline since the Bool if the car is oscillating from the centerline is False.
The Bool if the car is on the racing line is False, which is not the case as the car's deviation is within the s-coordinate range.
The Bool if the car is reversing is True, which is not the case as the car's deviation is within the s-coordinate range.
