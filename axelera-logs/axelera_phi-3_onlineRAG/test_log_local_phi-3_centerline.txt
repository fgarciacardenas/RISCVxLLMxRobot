        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.

Model Response: <h3>Brief Explanation:</h3>
<p>Adhering to Human: <strong>False</strong>
<h4>Reasoning:</h4>
<p>The car's current average speed along the racing line (s-speed) is given as 6 m/s, which is between the usual speeds of 5 and 7 m/s. The car is not reversing, facing the wall, and the oscillations in the d-coordinate are negligible (0.3 m or less), which are the conditions for the car to be considered stopped.</p>
<h4>Analysis:</h4>
<p>The car's current speed (6 m/s) is not above the specified 3 m/s, and the oscillations in the d-coordinate (0.3 m or less) are not negligible. Therefore, the car is not adhering to the human's requirements.</p>
<h4>Calculation:</h4>
<p>The car's current average speed (s-speed) is given as 6 m/s, which is above the specified 0.5 m/s. The car is not adhering to the human's requirements of driving faster than 3 m/s.</p>
<h4>Adjustment:</h4>
<p>To adhere to the human's request, the car should be driving at a speed of 6 m/s, which is the minimum acceptable speed to be considered as adhering.</p>

Model Response: The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate, which is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The bool if the car is facing the center is False, which means the car is not oscillating around the center.
The bool if the car is oscillating around the wall is False, which means the car is not oscillating around the wall.
The bool if the car is facing the center is False, which means the car is not oscillating around the center.
The bool if the car is oscillating around the wall is False, which means the car is not oscillating around the wall.
The bool if the car is facing the center is False, which means the car is not oscillating around the center.
The bool if the car is oscillating around the wall is False, which means the car is not oscillating around the wall.

Test Case: Drive on the racing line
Sample Index: 18
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 13 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.5, 5.8, 5.9, 6.0, 5.8, 6.1, 6.2, 5.9, 6.0, 6.1]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
