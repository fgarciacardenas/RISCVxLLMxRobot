Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.

        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 13 samples.

Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        Explanation: The car is not adhering to the human's desire to drive on the centerline. The lateral deviation from the racing line is consistently 0.1m, which is within the acceptable range, but the car is not oscillating around the racing line as per Hint 7. Additionally, the car is not maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m from both walls, which is against Hint 3.
