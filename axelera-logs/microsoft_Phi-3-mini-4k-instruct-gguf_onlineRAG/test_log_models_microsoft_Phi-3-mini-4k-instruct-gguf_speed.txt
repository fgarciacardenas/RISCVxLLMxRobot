Model Response: 
- [response]: Explanation: The car is not moving as indicated by the data provided, which shows no change in position, speed, or deviation from the racing line over the 5-second sample period. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is increasing, but it is not close to 0m/s, so it is not stopped. The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) and speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) are within the negligible range, indicating the car is maintaining a consistent position on the racing line. The distances to the walls are also within safe limits, and the car is not reversing or facing the wall.

        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Don't move 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 10 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 1.5, 3.1, 4.6, 6.2, 7.8, 9.3, 10.9, 12.4, 14.0]

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.

        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 3 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 15, 20]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.2, 0.1]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [5, 5.5, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.2, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [2, 2.1, 2.2]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.9, 1.8, 1.7]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: 
- [response]: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) values are within the acceptable range (below 0.3m), indicating it is mostly on the racing line. However, there are instances (at the 3rd and 6th samples) where the deviation is -0.1m and -0.2m respectively, which are not considered off the racing line. The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is consistently above 0.2m/s, suggesting it is not maintaining a minimal curvature trajectory. The oscillation in the d-coordinate (from positive to negative values) also indicates the car is not strictly following the racing line. The distances to the walls are within a safe range, and the car is not reversing or crashing.
