        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Don't move 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 5 seconds in 15 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7]

        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5, 6.5]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.7, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5]

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

Model Response: 
- response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) values are all below 0.3m, indicating it is staying on the racing line. The left and right distances to the walls are relatively close to each other, suggesting the car is on the centerline. However, the d-coordinate values oscillate, which indicates the car is slightly oscillating around the racing line. Despite this, the car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: 
- response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) values are all below 0.3m, indicating that the car is generally staying on the racing line. However, there are instances where the deviation exceeds 0.3m (at the 5th, 6th, and 7th samples), suggesting the car is oscillating around the racing line. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is generally increasing, with a slight decrease at the 6th sample, which could be due to the oscillation. The distances to the walls are within a safe range, and the car is not reversing or crashing. The car is not facing the wall either.

Adhering to Human: False

Test Case: Drive on the racing line
Sample Index: 22
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 3 seconds in 14 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.05, 0, -0.05, -0.1, -0.05, 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.05, 0, -0.05, -0.1, -0.05]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, 7, 6.9, 6.8, 6.7]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0, -0.1, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.1, 0, -0.1, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.1]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.5]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.8, 1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False


   
        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive on the racing line. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: 
        Explanation: The car is mostly on the racing line as indicated by the s-coordinate, but there are moments where the d-coordinate suggests the car is not on the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: False
