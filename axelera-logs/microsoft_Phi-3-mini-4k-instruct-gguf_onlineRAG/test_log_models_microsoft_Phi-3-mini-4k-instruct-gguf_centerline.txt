        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

        - The distance to the right wall is: [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: False

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 1:
If the d-speed is above than 0.5m/s is high.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.


    
        Check if the car is adhering to what the human wants: Drive faster than 3 m/s. Strictly reply in the following format: 

        Explanation: <Brief Explanation> 

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: 
- [response]: Explanation: The car's current average speed along the racing line is calculated by summing the s-speed values and dividing by the number of samples. The average speed is (6+6+6+6+6+6+6+6)/8 = 6 m/s, which is within the usual driving range of 5 to 7 m/s but does not exceed the human's requirement of driving faster than 3 m/s.

Adhering to Human: False

Sanitized Output: False
Expected Output: True

Test Case: Drive faster than 3 m/s
Sample Index: 18
Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive faster than 3 m/s
