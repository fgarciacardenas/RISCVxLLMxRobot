        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 9:
If the human requires you to drive at a certain speed, first calculate the current average speed and compare it to what the human wants.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: 
        Explanation: The car is driving forward as indicated by the positive s-coordinate values, which represent the car's position along the racing line. The car's speed is within the typical range of 5 to 7 m/s, and it is not reversing or crashing. However, the car is oscillating around the racing line, as indicated by the d-coordinate values oscillating from positive to negative with a magnitude greater than 0.3 meters.

        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 6 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [5, 4.8, 4.6, 4.4, 4.2, 4]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.1, 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0, -0.05]

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.

        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the centerline 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 6 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 9.5, 9, 8.5, 8, 7.5]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.2, 0.1, 0, -0.1, -0.2, -0.3]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [-2.5, -2.5, -2.5, -2.5, -2.5, -2.5]

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Drive on the racing line 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 0 seconds in 10 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [50, 48, 46, 44, 42, 40, 38, 36, 34, 32]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0, -0.1, -0.2, -0.3, -0.4]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [-2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1]

        - The distance to the right wall is: [1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4]

 
        - Bool if the car is reversing: True

          
        - Bool if the car has crashed: False

        
        - Bool if the car is facing the wall: False

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: 

        Explanation: The car is driving on the racing line as indicated by the s-coordinate, which shows a consistent decrease in position along the track. The lateral deviation is within acceptable limits, indicating the car is not significantly off the racing line. The car is not reversing, has not crashed, and is not facing the wall.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: 
- response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is consistently below 0.3m, indicating it is staying on the racing line. The d-coordinate does not oscillate with a magnitude larger than 0.3m, suggesting the car is not oscillating around the racing line. The distances to the left and right walls are not equal, but they are not close to the walls (all values are above 0.4m), which means the car is not close to the walls. The car is not reversing and has not crashed.
