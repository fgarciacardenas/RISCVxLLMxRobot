        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:

Prompt: 
        You are an AI embodied on an autonomous racing car. The human wants to: Don't move 

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 1 seconds in 14 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, 14, 14.5, 15, 15.5, 16, 16.5]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.3, -0.4, 0.5, -0.5, 0.4, -0.3, 0.5, -0.4, 0.4, -0.5, 0.5, -0.4, 0.3, -0.3]

        
        - The car's speed along the racing line is given by the s-speed: [5.5, 6, 5.8, 6.2, 5.9, 5.7, 6.1, 5.8, 6, 5.9, 6.2, 5.8, 6, 5.9]

        
        - The car's speed perpendicular to the racing line is given by the d-speed: [0.6, 0.7, 0.6, 0.7, 0.6, 0.7, 0.6, 0.7, 0.6, 0.7, 0.6, 0.7, 0.6, 0.7]

        
        - The distance to the left wall is: [1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 0.9, 0.8, 1, 0.9, 0.8, 1, 0.9, 1, 0.9]


        - The distance to the right wall is: [0.9, 1, 0.9, 1, 0.8, 1, 0.9, 0.8, 1, 0.9, 1, 0.8, 0.9, 1]

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 3 samples.
        
        - The car's position along the racing line is given by the s-coordinate: [10, 15, 20]

        
        - The car's lateral deviation from the racing line is given by the d-coordinate: [0.5, -0.5, 0.5]

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 2:
Unless specified differently by the human, the car is usually driving at speeds between 5 and 7m/s.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.

Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.

A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.
Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 7:
If the d-coordinate oscillates from positive to negative values with larger magnitude than 0.3 metres, then the car is oscillating around the racing line.
Hint 10:
You are on the centerline if the left and right distances to the walls are about equal.
Hint 3:

Model Response: 
- response: Explanation: The car's lateral deviation (d-coordinate) values are all above 0.3m, indicating that the car is not consistently on the racing line. However, the oscillation in the d-coordinate values is within the threshold of 0.3m, suggesting that the car is oscillating around the racing line rather than deviating significantly from it. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is constant, which is ideal for maintaining a steady pace. The distances to the left and right walls are not equal, but they are not indicating a crash or reversing.
