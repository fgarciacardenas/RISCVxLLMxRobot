The lateral deviation (d-coordinate) is consistently at 0.2 meters, which is below the threshold of 0.3 meters, indicating the car is not deviating from the racing line. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is zero, which is expected as the car is not moving forward or backward. The speed perpendicular to the racing line (d-speed) is also zero, which means the car is not moving sideways. The distances to the left and right walls are equal at 1.5 meters, suggesting the car is centered on the track. The car is not reversing, as indicated by the False value for the reversing bool, and it has not crashed, as the crashed bool is False. Lastly, the car is not facing the wall, as the facing the wall bool is False.\n\n\nAdhering to Human: True", "sanitized_output": true, "structure_followed": true, "expected_output": false, "prompt_tokens": 772, "rag_tokens": 160, "output_tokens": 221, "model_name": "unsloth_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"}
