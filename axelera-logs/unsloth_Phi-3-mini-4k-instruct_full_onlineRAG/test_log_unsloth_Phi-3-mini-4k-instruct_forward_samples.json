The oscillation in the d-coordinate is minimal and does not exceed the threshold, suggesting that the car is not significantly deviating from the racing line. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is consistent, which is ideal for maintaining a good lap time. The distances to the left and right walls are approximately equal, which means the car is centered on the track. The car is not reversing and is not crashing, and it is not facing the wall, as the distances to the walls are not extremely small.\n\n\nAdhering to Human: True", "sanitized_output": true, "structure_followed": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 646, "rag_tokens": 160, "output_tokens": 159, "model_name": "unsloth_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"}

The oscillation around the racing line is minimal and does not exceed the threshold of 0.3m, suggesting that the car is not significantly deviating from the optimal path. The car's speed along the racing line (s-speed) is relatively consistent, which is a good sign for maintaining a high lap time. The distances to the left and right walls are approximately equal, which means the car is not significantly deviating from the centerline. The car is not reversing, not crashing, and not facing the wall, which are all positive indicators.\n\n\nAdhering to Human: True", "sanitized_output": true, "structure_followed": true, "expected_output": true, "prompt_tokens": 820, "rag_tokens": 160, "output_tokens": 174, "model_name": "unsloth_Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"}
