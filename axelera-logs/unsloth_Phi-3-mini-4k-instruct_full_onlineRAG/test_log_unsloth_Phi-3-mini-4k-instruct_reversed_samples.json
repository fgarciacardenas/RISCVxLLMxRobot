The car is driving forwards, as indicated by the negative s-speed values. The oscillation of the d-coordinate around the racing line is minimal and does not exceed the 0.3m threshold, suggesting that the car is not significantly deviating from the optimal path. The distances to both the left and right walls are relatively equal, which means the car is not significantly close to either wall.
