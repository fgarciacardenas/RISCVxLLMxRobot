        The car is currently on the track, data available is in the Frenet Corrdinate frame, units are in meters and meters per second. 
        The racing line is a minimal curvature trajectory to optimize the lap time.
        The data has been sampled for 2 seconds in 3 samples.

        Use these guides to reason: 

Hint 11:
Unless told otherwise, you should be driving forwards!
Hint 3:
If the distance to a wall is smaller than 0.4m, the car is close to that wall. Staying close to the wall means maintaining a consistent distance below 0.4m.
Hint 4:
If the s-speed is close to 0m/s, then the car is stopped.
Hint 8:
Oscillations in d-coordinate under 0.3m or d-speed under 0.5m/s are negligible.
Hint 6:
A d-coordinate above 0.3m is considered not to be on the racing line.

Model Response: Explanation: The car is currently driving at an average speed of 6 m/s along the racing line, which is within the usual speed range of 5 to 7 m/s. The car is not stopped, as the s-speed is not close to 0 m/s. There are no significant deviations from the racing line, as indicated by the d-coordinate and d-speed being zero. The car is not reversing, and there is no indication of a crash. The car is not facing the wall, as the distances to both walls are equal.

Adhering to Human: False


The human wants the car to drive faster than 3 m/s. The car's current average speed is 6 m/s, which is above the human's desired speed. However, since the car is not exceeding the human's specified speed, it is not adhering to the human's request to drive faster than 3 m/s.

        Adhering to Human: <True/False> 

        
Model Response: Explanation: The car is currently driving at an average speed of 6 m/s along the racing line, which is within the usual speed range of 5 to 7 m/s. The car is not stopped, as the s-speed is not close to 0 m/s. There are no significant deviations from the racing line (d-coordinate and d-speed are both 0), and the car is not reversing or facing the wall.

Adhering to Human: False


The human wants the car to drive faster than 3 m/s, but the car is currently driving at an average speed of 6 m/s, which is already above the desired speed. Therefore, the car is adhering to the human's request.
